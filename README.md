# BilalDot Dotfiles
> the latest version is 1.0.2

An half-advanced configuration of Hyprland for Arch Linux based distributions. It has Pywal coloring, settings app, welcome app and lot of more...

Inspired by [ML4W Dotfiles](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/tree/main). If you don't like mine, you can look at [this](https://github.com/mylinuxforwork/dotfiles/tree/main).

## Installation
I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the BilalDot Dotfiles.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions here: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/

After installing Hyprland, run this command in Bash, it will install automatically.
```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilal1545/bilaldot/install.sh)
```

> IMPORTANT: I cannot guarantee that the BilalDot Dotfiles will work everywhere. You install at your own risk.
