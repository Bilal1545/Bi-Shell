# Bi-Shell Dotfiles
> the latest version is 2.0

An desktop shell for Hyprland and Arch Linux based distributions (optional). It has dynamic coloring, settings app, bar, app launcher and lot of more...

## Installation
I recommend to install a base Hyprland system before installing the Bi-Shell Dotfiles.

You can find the Hyprland Installation instructions here: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Getting-Started/Installation/

After installing Hyprland, run this command in Bash, it will install apps and shell.
```shell
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bilal1545/bilaldot/install.sh)
```

Finally, at the beginning of the hyprland config file (~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf) paste this:

```shell
source = ~/.config/hypr/Bi-Shell.conf
```

> IMPORTANT: I cannot guarantee that the BilalDot Dotfiles will work everywhere. You install at your own risk.
